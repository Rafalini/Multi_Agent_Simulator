Simulator of couriers, who deliver goods form point A to point B using optimal route. Simulation time is assumed to be 8 hour (from 22:00 to 06:00), during witch couriers should deliver their load. Each courier has limited load space, extending load to deliver above loading capacity will result in multiple courses on route.

Routes can be overloaded by traffic (red color). When that happens agents slow down. 

Agent can suffer from accident, which means that he will be unable to continue delivering his goods.
